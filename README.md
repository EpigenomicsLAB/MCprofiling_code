## MC profiling: a novel approach to analyze DNA methylation heterogeneity in genome-wide bisulfite sequencing data
This directory contains the R software that implements MC profiling.
Methylation Class (MC) profiling is a genome-wide approach to the study of DNA methylation heterogeneity from bulk bisulfite sequencing experiments. 
This approach is built on the concept of MCs, groups of DNA molecules sharing the same number of methylated cytosines. 
The relative abundances of MCs from sequencing reads incorporates the information on the average methylation, and directly informs on the methylation level of each molecule.
